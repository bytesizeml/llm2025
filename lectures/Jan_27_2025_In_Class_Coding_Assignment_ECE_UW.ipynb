        "Search is an area that a lot of companies have invested in. Any retail company has a search engine of its own to serve its products. But how many of them include semantics in search? Search is typically done through Tries. But when we bring semantics to search, the ball game entirely changes. Searching with semantics can help address tail queries whereas Trie searches are usually geared for head queries.\n",
        "One of the bottlenecks in including semantics in search is latency - The more sophisticated the search, the slower the search inference will be. This is why for semantic search, there is no one-stop solution in a real-world scenario. Even though we have ChatGPT to return amazing results with the right prompting, we know what the latency this will incur, thus making it less viable in this scenario :-)\n",
